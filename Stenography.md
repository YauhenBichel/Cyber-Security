Cryptography (Crypto) hides the meaning of a message so that only the intended recipient can read it. However, it does not hide the message itself;  it is still clear to others that a MESSAGE has been sent and that there was clear intention to hide the MEANING of the message from others except an intended recipient. From a law-enforcement perspective this might be significant in itself.
Steganography (Steg)  hides the actual message itself whether encrypted or not. 

The use of steg and crypto together makes for a formidable barrier to any interception and reading of the contents of a message and is highly favoured by criminals.

Steganography means hiding data in other information e.g: “Greetings from New York!!! It’s sunny!” 
BUT let’s say you have previously agreed with the receiver that every 9th character (not spaces) was part of a secret message. Greetings from New York!!! It’s sunny! becomes SOS.
But information can be hidden in all sorts of computerised applications e.g wordprocessed documents, spreadsheets, programs, music files, picture files.
