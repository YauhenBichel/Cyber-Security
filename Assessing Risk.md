## Vulnerability Assessment
 All networks, hosts and applications have vulnerabilities
Definition:-
 “A flaw or weakness in a system’s design, implementation
or operation and management that could be exploited to
violate the system’s security policy”
 Knowing how to assess vulnerability is critical to your
security

 Describing vulnerability
     Design errors
     Input validation
     Buffer overflows
     SQL injection
     XSS
     Race conditions – timing errors

 Some may overlap – SQL injection and Input validation
 All exploits require a vulnerability
 Most serious – zero-day exploit

## OWASP Top Ten Vulnerabilities
1. Injection
2. Broken Authentication
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
4. XML External Entity (XXE)
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring


## Threat Level
 Determined by - availability of the exploit popularity and publicity available remediation

 Threats change over time
 Degree of difficulty varies – e.g., where attacker must be and the complexity of exploiting vulnerability

 Risk – the expected loss from an attack
     Loss of confidentiality
     Denial of service
     Data integrity

## Cost
 Consequences of a successful exploit
 Consequences in several areas should be analysed
     Financial cost
     Cost to reputation
     Cost to organisation’s security
 Cost relates to system’s use
     Mission critical systems
     Widely used network applications
 Assets change over time
     Decommissioning
     Criticality changes
