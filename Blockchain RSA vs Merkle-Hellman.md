The Merkle-Hellman (knapsack) algorithm is an asymmetric (two-key) encryption (like RSA) however, unlike RSA, it only works one-way e.g
In RSA one can:-
 encrypt with public key and decrypt with private key
OR
encrypt with private key and decrypt with public key
But in Merkle-Hellman one can only:-
Encrypt with Private key and decrypt with public key
And the alternative does not work.
Merkle-Helman has found use in blockchain encryption especially in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.
