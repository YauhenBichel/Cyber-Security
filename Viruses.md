- Self-replicating computer program
- Infects other programs
- Carries instructional code for making perfect copies of itself
- Particular operating system
- Specific hardware platform

## Stages
Virus goes through four stages
1. Dormant stage - not all have this stage
2. Propagation phase – copies itself
3. Triggering phase – caused by some event
- count of the number of copies made
- a particular date, etc.
4. Execution phase – do damage!

## Antivirus protection
Prevention
- Detection (locate the virus)
- Identification (identify the specific virus)
- Removal

### Currently four generations of antivirus software
- scanners
- heuristic rules - look for fragments of code
- memory-resident programs - watch for activity associated with
infection attempts
- fourth gen. uses all of these + access control capability, AI
which limits ability of viruses to penetrate a system
