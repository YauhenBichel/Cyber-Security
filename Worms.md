Worm uses one of the following:-
- Email facility
- Remote execution capability – executes a copy of itself on

- File-sharing services 

## State of Worm Technology
- Multi-platform – not just MS
- Multi-exploit – web servers, email, browsers, networkbased applications
- Ultrafast spreading – obtain suitable IP addresses
- Polymorphic – each copy has new code
- Metamorphic – repertoire of behaviour patterns
- Transport vehicles – ideal for spreading other DDoS
tools (e.g., zombies)
- Zero-day exploit – exploits an unknown vulnerability
